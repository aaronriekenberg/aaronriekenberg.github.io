I like this quote:

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.

I thought this was from Mark Twain, but [originally](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1196bgx/til_mark_twain_is_often_wrongly_credited_with_the/) seems to be from [Blaise Pascal in Lettres Provinciales](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/02/03/270680304/this-could-have-been-shorter).

When writing English my first drafts usually have too many words.  With effort I can revise and make it concise.

A rough metric for me seems to be removing half of my original words (no joke).

Maybe blogging is a chance to practice this.
