I really like [Go](https://go.dev).

Let me count some ways:

- Simple object system
- Easy to understand minimal sytax
- Great docoumentation
- Go routines for concurrency
- One way to do things including networking and go routines
- High quality http client/server built in
- Single file executable, static linking, no runtime dependencies
- Crazy fast builds
- Go modules
- Cross compilation
- One way to write tests
- Built in benchmarking
- Crazy low memory usage with JVM
- Crazy fast GC compared with JVM
