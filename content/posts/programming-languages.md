A well-known [quote](https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html) from [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) the creator of C++:

> There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.

I can definitely understand the sentiment of this having experience with a number of popular and not-so-popular languages in my career from C and C++ to Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, and even Ada.

To try something positive I am going to write about some points I like from my favorite languages, why I like them, and why I might choose to use one over another.
